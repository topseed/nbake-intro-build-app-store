# nbake-intro-native-app-store

SPA/PWA is good for native/hybrida/cross platform app store, Apple and Andorid.

Some PWA options include Ionic, Framework7 and TurboLinks
 ( ex: http://youtube.com/watch?v=SWEts0rlezA )

In our case, we have a good router, similar to crossroads.js, ts-router.

For cool transition effects, uncomment line 87 in setup.js ( in public )

You can see that in PWA there is more compolexity becuase more things are in scope.

PWA is harder and requires a sr dev on team to deal w/ Cordova builds.
Check out README2.md to deploy to App store.

Important: deploy this app (from public folder ) to cloud, ex: via 'now' from zeit before part 2.
